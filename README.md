# House price prediction: Advanced regression 

We implement advanced regression models using "Xgboost" and "ANN" to predict a house price out of a complex dataset. Please see "data_description.txt" file. 

The steps we follow;
   - Importing datasets
   - Cleaning the dataset 
   - Handle categorical features
   - Train the models 
   - RandomizedSearchCV is used to select optimal model parameters
       - for Xgboost algorithm
   - Evaluate the performace of the models and compair their potential on the test data
